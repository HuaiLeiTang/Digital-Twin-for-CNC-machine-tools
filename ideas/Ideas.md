# New ideas about Digital Twin for CNC machine tool
## About DT decision model and parameter optimization model
Tensorflow 2.0 released by Google supports reinforcement learning agent, which can be used to construct digital twin decision model and parameter optimization model. In fact, after the DT is built, all kinds of possible faults can be simulated in advance, and then the fault mode library of the equipment can be established. After the corresponding situation of the equipment occurs, the equipment mode and fault can be searched and matched. This idea is the same as the optimal decision-making of equipment operation  by reinforcement learning and simulation transfer  learning based on simulation. In fact, the normal optimization and fault of the equipment are special cases of the state of the equipment at a certain time, which can be obtained by DT simulation, which is also the advantage of DT. Simulate the good or bad that may happen in advance, and then migrate to the device.
