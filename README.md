# Digital twin for CNC machine tool
This ia a research project of Digital Twin(DT) for CNC machine tool(CNCMT).


## Overview:

Predictive maintenance based on Digital Twin requires a cutting edge data platform in order to handle fast streams of  IoT data, with the processing required for on-the-fly feature engineering, and the flexibility required for data science and machine learning.

## Overall framework of Digital Twin with the cloud and edge computing
This is the conceived implementation framework of digital twin, including machine tool perception data acquisition, storage, analysis and processing based on message queue; machine learning model construction, training, verification, deployment, service and model adaptation and application for specific application scenarios.

Predictive maintenance is an effective method to avoid faults and casualties. Due to less consideration of the status variety and consistency of CNCMT in its life cycle, current methods cannot achieve accurate, timely and intelligent results. To realize reliable predictive maintenance of CNCMT, a hybrid approach driven by Digital Twin is used. With this framework, a hybrid predictive maintenance algorithm based on DT model and DT data is researched.
