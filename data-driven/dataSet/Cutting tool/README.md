# CNC Milling cutting tool run-to-failure dataset
Dataset can be downloaded form this [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-aEqCWVR2dho4GKdTw0ZBQ).

For a cutting tool, it was tested by 315 cutting times run to failure experiment, and the wear value of cutting tool was monitored by specific instruments after each cutting time.  And 3 this experiments were done, so we got 3 dataset, 2 as training and 1 as testing. Each dataset contains 3 directions vibration data, 3 directions cutting force data, and 1 acoustic emission signal.

 In this experiment, spindle speed is 10400RPM, diameter of milling tool is 6mm, feeding speed is 1555 mm/min, and sample frequency is 50KHz.
